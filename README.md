# Arduino Motor Control

This program uses Arduino to take in values from three potentiometers and accurately control the angle of three motors. 

## Prerequisites

To use this program, you will need the following items: 
- Arduino Board
- 3 Potentiometers
- 3 Motors
- Breadboard
- Jumpers

## Installation

1. Connect the Arduino Board to your computer. 
2. Connect a jumper from each of the potentiometers to the Arduino Board. 
3. Connect the 3 motors to the Arduino Board.
4. Connect a jumper from each of the motors to the Arduino Board. 
5. Connect the Breadboard to the Arduino Board. 

## Usage

1. Upload the program to the Arduino Board. 
2. Adjust the potentiometers to the desired angle. 
3. The motors will now rotate to match the angle of the potentiometers.
